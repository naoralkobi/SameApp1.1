*** Welcome to SAME app. ***

First, we are sorry that we dont have commits from different users.
we had some technic problems because Naor is using mac and Aviv is using windows and when we try to do commits and clone it was caused some problems.
so we had 2 different repositories, and this is the final result.

In order to use our app, follow the next simple steps:

1. clone our repository.
2. run the app.
3. register to the app.
4. log in and start converstation.


**NOTE : you can speak only with users that logged in, in the same time with you. **

In order to check our app, register from at least 2 users, and log in into each of them. (you can use 2 different browsers)
once you did it - you can add a new contact to your chat and write them messages.

in this version, you can only send text messeages.

When you add a new contact - you need to supply:
1. his UserName that he registered with to the app DB.
2. a nickname that you want.
3. his server.

** NOTE : if you want to send a message, first click on the chat, and only after you see the chat opened - send it. **

notice that each login session stands for 6000 seconds, and then the session will end and you will need to login again.

Thank you and enjoy :)
