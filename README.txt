Testing the App
To fully test the capabilities of SAME App, we recommend following these steps:

Register at least two users:

Use two different browsers or browser profiles (e.g., Chrome and Firefox) for each user.
Register each user separately using the registration form.
Log in to each user account:

Open the web browser for User 1 and enter the login credentials.
Repeat the same process for User 2 on a different browser or browser profile.
Add contacts and start conversations:

User 1 should add User 2 as a contact by providing their registered username, a desired nickname, and the server.
User 2 should also add User 1 as a contact using the same steps.
Once contacts are added, both users can start sending text messages to each other.
Note: Ensure that you click on the chat window before sending a message to avoid any issues.

Session Timeout
Please note that each login session is valid for 6000 seconds (approximately 100 minutes). After this duration, the session will expire, and you will need to log in again to continue using the app.

Thank you for choosing SAME App. We hope you enjoy your messaging experience!
